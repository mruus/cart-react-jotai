To deploy a React application to GitHub Pages using Vite, you can follow these steps:

1. In your project's root directory, install the `vite-plugin-gh-pages` package as a dev dependency:
```
npm install vite-plugin-gh-pages --save-dev
```

2. In your `vite.config.js` file, add the following configuration to enable the `vite-plugin-gh-pages` plugin and set the base URL for your GitHub Pages site (replace `username` and `repo` with your GitHub username and repository name):
```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import reactRefresh from '@vitejs/plugin-react-refresh';
import ghPages from 'vite-plugin-gh-pages';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [reactRefresh(), ghPages({
    base: '/repo'
  })]
});
```

3. In your `package.json` file, add a new script to build and deploy your app to GitHub Pages:
```json
{
  "name": "my-react-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "deploy": "vite build && vite --ssr src/index.jsx && gh-pages -d dist"
  }
}
```

4. Run the following command to build and deploy your application to GitHub Pages:
```
npm run deploy
```
This command will build your app, generate a static site with server-side rendering, and deploy it to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository. After a few minutes, your app should be available at `https://username.github.io/repo`.

That's it! Your React app is now deployed to GitHub Pages using Vite. You can use this process to deploy any React app to GitHub Pages using Vite.
